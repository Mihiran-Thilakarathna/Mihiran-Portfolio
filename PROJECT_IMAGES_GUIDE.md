# Project Images Setup Guide

## ✅ Projects Section Update - COMPLETE!

### What Was Done:

1. **✅ "Live" and "Code" Buttons Added**
   - Each project card now has two horizontally-aligned buttons
   - **"Live" button** (gradient blue/purple) → links to live demo or GitHub releases
   - **"Code" button** (outlined) → links to GitHub repository
   - Both buttons have hover effects and smooth transitions

2. **✅ Image Integration Setup**
   - All 6 projects are now configured to use images from `src/assets/`
   - Images are properly imported at the top of `portfolio.ts`
   - Vite will optimize and bundle these images automatically

3. **✅ Types & Filters Updated**
   - Added "Desktop Application" category to type definitions
   - Updated project filters to include all 4 categories
   - All TypeScript errors resolved

## 📁 Current Image Mapping

Your existing images in `src/assets/` are now connected to projects:

| Project | Image File | Status |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| **AI Chat Assistant** | `AI-Chat-Assistant.jpg` | ✅ Connected |
| **Java Swing Calculator** | `calculator-screenshot.png` | ✅ Connected |
| **Fiora Video Editor** | `fiora editor.png` | ✅ Connected |
| **Personal Organizer** | `Personal-organizer.webp` | ✅ Connected |
| **Opal Muse Clothing** | `opal-muse.jpg` | ✅ Connected |
| **Mood Music App** | `moodmusic.webp` | ✅ Connected |

## 🎨 Image Recommendations

For best results, project images should be:

- **Dimensions**: 800x500px or 1600x1000px (16:10 aspect ratio)
- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **Size**: Under 500KB per image (optimize for web)
- **Content**: Screenshots, mockups, or representative graphics

## 🔄 How to Replace/Update Images

### Option 1: Replace Existing Files
Simply replace the image files in `src/assets/` with new ones **using the same filename**. The portfolio will automatically update!

### Option 2: Add New Images
1. Add your image to `src/assets/`
2. Import it in `src/data/portfolio.ts`:
   ```typescript
   import myNewProjectImage from '../assets/my-project.jpg';
   ```
3. Use it in a project object:
   ```typescript
   {
     id: 7,
     title: 'My New Project',
     image: myNewProjectImage,
     // ... other fields
   }
   ```

---

## 🎯 Project URLs

All projects now have both `liveUrl` and `codeUrl`:

```typescript
{
  liveUrl: 'https://github.com/username/project/releases',  // Live demo
  codeUrl: 'https://github.com/username/project.git',       // Source code
}
```

**Note**: For desktop applications without live demos, the `liveUrl` points to GitHub Releases where users can download the app.

---

## 🎨 Button Styles

The buttons are automatically styled with:

- **Live Button**: Gradient background (purple to blue), white text
- **Code Button**: Transparent with purple border, fills on hover
- **Icons**: External link icon for Live, GitHub icon for Code
- **Layout**: Flexbox with equal width, centered in the card

---

## 🚀 What's Next?

Your portfolio is now fully functional with:
- ✅ Expandable work experience cards
- ✅ 3D hover effect on hero image
- ✅ Improved navigation scroll spy
- ✅ Project cards with Live/Code buttons
- ✅ All project images integrated

The dev server should now display everything correctly at `http://localhost:5173/`!

---

## 📝 Future Enhancements (Optional)

If you want to add more projects later:

1. Add the image to `src/assets/`
2. Import it at the top of `portfolio.ts`
3. Add a new project object to the `projects` array
4. Update the `id` to be unique
5. Fill in all required fields (title, date, description, image, category, tags, urls)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Images not showing?**
- Check that image filenames match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Make sure images are in `src/assets/` folder
- Clear browser cache and refresh

**Build errors?**
- Ensure all image imports at the top of `portfolio.ts` are correct
- Verify no special characters in filenames (spaces are OK with quotes)

---

## 💡 Tips

- Use high-quality screenshots of your projects
- Keep image file sizes optimized for web
- Use consistent aspect ratios across all project images
- Consider adding hover effects or animations to images (already implemented in CSS!)

---

Your portfolio now has a professional Projects section with:
- 6 fully configured projects with images
- Live demo and GitHub links for each project
