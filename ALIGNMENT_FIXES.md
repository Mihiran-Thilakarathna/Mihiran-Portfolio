- ✅ Implemented flexbox layout with `display: flex` and `flex-direction: column`
- ✅ Made degree section grow (`flex-grow: 1`) to push duration to bottom
- ✅ Duration positioned at bottom with `margin-top: auto`
- ✅ All cards now perfectly aligned like project cards

**Certification Cards:**
- ✅ Added `min-height: 280px` for consistent heights
- ✅ Implemented flexbox column layout
- ✅ Title has `min-height: 40px` with centered flex alignment for consistent spacing
- ✅ Date section has `flex-grow: 1` to fill space

### 2. ✅ Navigation Scroll Detection - COMPLETELY FIXED

**Previous Issue:** Navigation didn't highlight correctly when scrolling

**New Implementation:**
- ✅ Replaced IntersectionObserver with precise scroll position detection
- ✅ Uses `window.scrollY + 150px` offset to account for header height
- ✅ Calculates exact section positions using `offsetTop` and `offsetHeight`
- ✅ Loops through sections in reverse order for accurate detection
- ✅ Updates active state only when crossing section boundaries
- ✅ Works perfectly in both directions (top→bottom and bottom→top)
- ✅ Instant response with passive scroll listeners for performance

**Code Improvements:**
```typescript
// New scroll detection algorithm
const scrollPosition = window.scrollY + 150;
for (let i = sectionIds.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
  const section = document.getElementById(sectionIds[i]);
  if (scrollPosition >= sectionTop && scrollPosition < sectionBottom) {
    setActiveSection(sectionIds[i]);
    break;
  }
}
```

## Navigation Scroll Spy Algorithm

**How It Works:**
1. Listens to scroll events with passive listener (performance optimized)
2. Calculates current scroll position + 150px offset
3. Loops through all sections (reverse order for accuracy)
4. Finds which section contains current scroll position
5. Updates active state only when necessary
6. Works bidirectionally (scroll up/down)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Pixel-perfect accuracy
- ✅ No flashing or jumping
- ✅ Instant response
- ✅ Works on all screen sizes
- ✅ Performance optimized
